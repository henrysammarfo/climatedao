# ClimateDAO Tribes Proposal

## Proposal for XDC × Tribes Hackathon Entry

### Proposal Title
ClimateDAO: AI-Powered Environmental Funding DAO

### Proposal Description

ClimateDAO is a comprehensive AI-powered decentralized autonomous organization built for the XDC × Tribes Hackathon. This project revolutionizes environmental funding by combining blockchain technology, AI impact assessment, and community governance to create a transparent, efficient platform for funding climate initiatives.

### Problem Statement

Current environmental funding suffers from:
- **Lack of Transparency**: Traditional funding mechanisms lack transparency and community input
- **Centralized Decision Making**: Funding decisions are made by a few without community participation  
- **No Objective Assessment**: Limited analysis of environmental project effectiveness
- **Geographic Barriers**: Global communities can't easily participate in local climate initiatives

### Solution Overview

ClimateDAO addresses these challenges through:

1. **AI-Powered Impact Assessment**: Real-time analysis using Hugging Face's Mistral-7B model
2. **Decentralized Governance**: CLIMATE token holders vote on proposals and fund distribution
3. **Transparent Funding**: All transactions are on-chain and verifiable on XDC Network
4. **Community Integration**: Full Tribes OS integration with XP, badges, events, and token-gated spaces
5. **Global Participation**: Anyone can propose, vote on, and fund environmental projects

### Technical Implementation

**Smart Contracts (XDC Apothem Testnet):**
- ClimateToken: `0x41d87298B54d329872c29ec385367cD4C404e8e6`
- ClimateDAO: `0xfD2CFC86e06c54d1ffe9B503391d91452a8Fd02D`
