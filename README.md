# ClimateDAO

An AI-powered on-chain DAO for funding and governing environmental projects, built on XDC Network with Tribes OS integration.

## Overview

ClimateDAO addresses the critical lack of transparent, community-driven funding for climate initiatives by leveraging blockchain technology for trustless donations and AI for objective impact assessment. The platform enables global participation in climate action through decentralized governance and funding mechanisms.

### The Problem
- **Lack of Transparency**: Traditional climate funding lacks transparency and community input
- **Centralized Decision Making**: Funding decisions are made by a few without community participation
- **No Impact Assessment**: Limited objective analysis of environmental project effectiveness
- **Geographic Barriers**: Global communities can't easily participate in local climate initiatives

### The Solution
ClimateDAO creates a decentralized platform where:
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Hugging Face Mistral-7B provides objective impact scoring and feasibility assessment
- **Community Governance**: CLIMATE token holders vote on proposals and fund distribution
- **Transparent Funding**: All transactions are on-chain and verifiable
- **Global Participation**: Anyone can propose, vote on, and fund environmental projects
- **Real Impact Tracking**: Monitor actual environmental outcomes of funded projects

## Features

- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven proposal creation and voting
- **AI-Powered Impact Assessment**: Automated analysis using Hugging Face Mistral-7B
- **Transparent Funding**: Blockchain-based donation tracking and fund distribution
- **Tribes OS Integration**: Real community management with XP/badges, events, and token-gated spaces
- **Real-time Analytics**: Impact scoring and project performance tracking
- **Tribe Token Economy**: ERC20 tokens for governance and community rewards

## Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: XDC Network (Apothem Testnet)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity 0.8.24
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1, Vite 5.4.3, TypeScript 5.5.4

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Git
- XDC wallet (MetaMask with XDC Network configured)
- Hugging Face API key (for AI features)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/henrysammarfo/climatedao.git
   cd climatedao
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install all dependencies (contracts + frontend)
   npm run install:all
   
   # Or install separately:
   cd contracts && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment files
   cp contracts/.env.example contracts/.env
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
   
   # Edit the .env files with your keys
   ```

4. **Compile Contracts**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

5. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   # Coverage: npm run coverage
   ```

6. **Deploy to Apothem Testnet**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

7. **Start Frontend**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### First Time Setup

1. **Get XDC Testnet Tokens**
   - Visit [XDC Faucet](https://faucet.apothem.network/)
   - Connect your wallet and request testnet XDC

2. **Configure MetaMask**
   - Network Name: XDC Apothem Testnet
   - RPC URL: https://rpc.apothem.network
   - Chain ID: 51
   - Currency Symbol: XDC

3. **Get Hugging Face API Key**
   - Visit [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
   - Create a new token with read access
   - Add to `frontend/.env` as `VITE_HF_API_KEY`
